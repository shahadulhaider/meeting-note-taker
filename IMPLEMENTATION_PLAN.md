## üîë Critical Path

These items MUST work for MVP success:

1. ‚úÖ User can login with Google
2. ‚úÖ User can upload audio file
3. ‚úÖ File gets processed asynchronously
4. ‚úÖ User sees real-time progress
5. ‚úÖ Transcript is generated and displayed
6. ‚úÖ Summary and action items are shown
7. ‚úÖ User can view past meetings

## üö¶ Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI API rate limits | Implement caching, use mock data for testing |
| Deployment issues | Test Docker locally first, have backup plan (Render) |
| WebSocket complexity | Fallback to polling if needed |
| Time constraints | Focus on critical path, skip nice-to-haves |
| Large file processing | Limit to 100MB, show clear error messages |
