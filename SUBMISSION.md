# Meeting Note Taker - Technical Assessment Submission

## Executive Summary

I have successfully built a functional clone of Fireflies.ai that provides meeting transcription, summarization, and action item extraction capabilities. The application demonstrates modern full-stack development practices using TypeScript throughout, real-time processing with job queues, and AI integration for intelligent content analysis.

## What Was Built

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Meeting Recording Simulation**
   - Audio file upload interface supporting MP3, WAV, and M4A formats
   - Secure file storage using Supabase Storage
   - File validation and size limits

2. **Transcription Service**
   - Primary: OpenAI Whisper API integration for accurate speech-to-text
   - Fallback: Google Gemini API for redundancy
   - Automatic fallback mechanism if primary service fails

3. **Summary & Action Items**
   - AI-powered meeting summarization
   - Intelligent extraction of action items with:
     - Task descriptions
     - Assignee identification (when mentioned)
     - Priority levels (high/medium/low)
   - Export functionality for complete transcripts

4. **User Interface**
   - Modern, responsive React application
   - Real-time progress updates during processing
   - Dashboard with meeting history
   - Detailed meeting view with tabs for summary, transcript, and action items
   - Google OAuth for secure authentication

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack Choices & Rationale

**Frontend:**
- **React + TypeScript**: Type safety and component reusability
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development experience
- **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI**: Rapid UI development with consistent design
- **Socket.io Client**: Real-time progress updates
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching

**Backend:**
- **Express + TypeScript**: Robust API development with type safety
- **BullMQ + Redis**: Scalable async job processing for long-running transcriptions
- **Socket.io**: WebSocket support for real-time updates
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations

**Infrastructure:**
- **Supabase**: All-in-one solution for auth, database, and storage
- **Docker**: Containerized Redis for local development
- **Turborepo**: Efficient monorepo management

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Used BullMQ job queue to handle potentially long transcription tasks without blocking the API
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation provides live feedback during processing
3. **Monorepo Structure**: Shared types between frontend and backend ensure consistency
4. **AI Service Redundancy**: Multiple AI providers ensure reliability
5. **Signed URLs**: Secure temporary access to private audio files

## Development Process

### Tools Used
- **Claude Code**: Primary development assistant for rapid prototyping and implementation
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for quick infrastructure setup
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion assistance
- **pnpm**: Efficient package management

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Audio file access from Supabase storage
   - **Solution**: Implemented signed URLs for secure, temporary file access

2. **Challenge**: AI model compatibility issues
   - **Solution**: Updated to supported models (gemini-1.5-flash) with proper error handling

3. **Challenge**: CORS issues with different frontend ports
   - **Solution**: Dynamic CORS configuration supporting multiple origins

4. **Challenge**: Action items not being extracted
   - **Solution**: Enhanced prompts and added fallback extraction logic

## Time Breakdown

**Total Time Spent: ~8 hours**

- Initial setup & architecture planning: 1 hour
- Backend API development: 2 hours  
- Frontend UI implementation: 2 hours
- AI integration & transcription services: 1.5 hours
- WebSocket real-time updates: 0.5 hours
- Bug fixes & improvements: 0.5 hours
- Documentation & README: 0.5 hours

## Assumptions Made

1. **Audio Processing**: Assumed uploaded files would be reasonable meeting lengths (< 100MB)
2. **Transcription Accuracy**: Relied on AI APIs for transcription rather than implementing custom speech recognition
3. **User Management**: Simplified to Google OAuth only, no email/password authentication
4. **Meeting Recording**: Simulated via file upload rather than real-time audio capture
5. **Storage**: Used Supabase's built-in storage rather than implementing custom CDN

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

If given more time, I would add:
- Real-time audio recording capability
- Meeting participant management
- Calendar integration
- Email notifications
- Search functionality across transcripts
- Multi-language support
- Meeting analytics dashboard
- Collaborative note editing

## Running the Application

Please refer to the README.md for detailed setup instructions. The application requires:
- Node.js 18+
- Docker for Redis
- Supabase account
- OpenAI and Google AI API keys

## Deployment Status

- [ ] Backend deployment to Railway (pending)
- [ ] Frontend deployment to Vercel (pending)
- [ ] GitHub repository (pending)

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates proficiency in:
- Full-stack TypeScript development
- Modern React patterns and state management
- Asynchronous processing with job queues
- Real-time communication with WebSockets
- AI API integration
- Database design and management
- Authentication and authorization
- Responsive UI/UX design

The application successfully replicates the core functionality of Fireflies.ai while maintaining clean code architecture and scalability considerations.
